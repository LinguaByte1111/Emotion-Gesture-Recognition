# Human Emotion and Gesture Detector üé≠ü§ñ

A dual-mode intelligent system that detects **human emotions** through facial expressions and identifies **hand gestures**, enabling advanced human-computer interaction. This project leverages deep learning techniques including **data augmentation**, **transfer learning** (VGG-16), and **Convolution Neural Network** to achieve high accuracy in real-time emotion and gesture recognition.

## About the Project

The **Human Emotion and Gesture Detector** is a computer vision project that recognizes facial emotions and hand gestures either **independently or simultaneously**. The system is capable of processing real-time video feeds and predicting the corresponding emotional or gestural state of the user.

‚úÖ **Accuracy: 87% on Emotion Recognition**
üì¶ Based on robust models with **VGG-16** and **Augmented CNNs**.

## Dataset and Preprocessing
### üìä
### üîπ Emotion Dataset

* **Source**: [FER2013 - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013)
* **Size**: \~35,000 labeled 48x48 grayscale facial images
* **Classes**: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral

### üîπ Preprocessing Steps:

* Converted CSV pixel data to image arrays
* Normalized pixel values to \[0, 1] range
* One-hot encoding of emotion labels
* Data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zooming) to improve generalization

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### üìà
Detailed EDA was performed to understand:

* Distribution of emotion categories
* Class imbalance analysis
* Gesture class mapping and visualizations
* Sample visual previews of both emotion and gesture datasets
* Heatmaps and confusion matrices post-training

EDA scripts are located in the `eda/` section (or embedded within Jupyter notebooks).

## Model Development
### üß†
### Emotion Recognition Models
### üé≠
1. **emotions\_train.py**

   * Baseline CNN with data augmentation
   * Relu, MaxPooling, Dropout layers
   * Achieved \~82% validation accuracy

2. **emotions\_final.py**

   * Enhanced architecture with improved regularization
   * Optimizer tuned (Adam with learning rate decay)
   * Final accuracy: **87%**

### Gesture Recognition Model
### ‚úã
* **gestures\_train.py**

  * Based on **VGG-16 pretrained model**
  * Custom dense layers added for gesture classification
  * Trained on a labeled dataset of hand gestures
  * Transfer learning helps speed up convergence
